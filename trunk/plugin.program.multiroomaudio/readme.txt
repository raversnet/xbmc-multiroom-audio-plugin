MultiroomAudio & Video Plugin v1.0.7
Author: VortexRotor (teshephe)
Based off of the very fine work of the Launcher Plugin - leo212  (Thanks Lior!!)

The purpose of this plugin is to facilitate the implementation and framework for a True Multi-Room "Syncronized Audio" 
AND Video solution for XBMC.  This is why I have chosen VLC as the program of choice for this effort. Not only does it support
just about all audio and video formats very well but it provides the inherent capability to provide client/server streaming 
syncronization over the local network which means that no more "out-of-phase" audio issues for those of you that have more
than one XBMC box in your home.



The release of Multiroom v1.0.7 plugin includes these New Features: 

- Full OS support (Linux, Windows, OSX)
- Extended Plugin Settings Dialogue for Initial and Advanced setup of Streaming Server
- Playing/Activating are now done via the generated PLS files located in the folder that you choose in the settings.  Once these are created
  you can create a shortcut to the folder location in either the Music and/or Video sections of XBMC using the "add source" in those sections.

  Note: As a result of this change/enhancement, the buttons for the AV sources in the MultiroomAV Plugin now only serve to De-Activate/Kill Streams (in or out)
        when selected and for management purposes such as Renaming, Removing, Editing parameters specific to the source. 



Known Issues's:
- Windows based systems can only be either a client or a master but not both
- Continuous play / Streaming of media is currently only supported on Window based systems. (XBMC Bug:#10106)




All comments, suggestions, help are very welcome.

FYI... at the moment the plugin requires that a master vlc streaming server be configured.  In my home I have the following:

                               ________________
                               |  Master XBMC  |<------------------> XMBC Remote (iPhone)  (You can use any app of your choice for control)

                               |_______________|  <-------------------| There are no speakers on this machine - I created a virtual sound out and i pipe all audio out to vlc.

There are alot of different ways to stream audio throughout the home but THE KEY is Syncronized AUDIO!!!!

This plugin requires the following:

XBMC 9.11 (Camelot) or higher
vlc 1.0 or higher (do: sudo apt-get vlc vlc-plugin* )


INSTALLATION:

After you have met the minimum dependencies mentioned in the WikiReadme?...

1) Place/copy the plugin in your ~/.xbmc/plugins/programs 

2) Proceed to Programs/Program plugins/MultiroomAudio? and bring up the context
   menu for the plugin and configure or keep the default settings and select OK to save the settings. 

3) Select MultiroomAudio? plugin and configure a source or two.
   Note: Define a source for localhost (the default is: udp://@224.1.1.152:1152) 

4) After defining your sources, Restart XBMC so the it uses the new playercorefactory.xml generated by the plugin. 

5) Now your good to go...
