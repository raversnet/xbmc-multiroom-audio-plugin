1.0.4 - 1.0.7 (BETA) rc45
- Added support for ALL OS's

- Manual On-Demand Streaming of Audio and/or Video from client or master hosts.

- Eliminated need for xdotool and wmctrl application making the plugin OS agnostic.

- Added deletion, renaming of Source generated files when source is renamed or removed

- Added generation of .PLS files for use as shortcuts in user defined folder location via Addon Settings (Misc Setting Section). 
  With this feature, the user can define a folder which can then be added as a Music/Video source respively in the Music 
  and/or Video sections of XBMC

- Playing/Activating are now done via the generated PLS files located in the folder that you choose in the settings.  Once these are created
  you can create a shortcut to the folder location in either the Music and/or Video sections of XBMC using the "add source" in those sections.
  Note: As a result of this change/enhancement, the buttons for the AV sources in the MultiroomAV Plugin now only serve to De-Activate/Kill Streams (in or out)
        when selected and for management purposes such as Renaming, Removing, Editing parameters specific to the source.
